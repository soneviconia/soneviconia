# Hi, my name is Wejkey

Here, on GH, I put my creations. Things you can use, or if not use, atleast look at them.
I do these things when Im bored, or when I use them on my other projects. So yeah, you can use them. But 99,99% are useless. But who knows, maybe you find something, you will use like I do. (I hope)

My primary project is my [Website](https://wejkey.github.io), you will find most of my projects here. But Im currently working on one, even cooler one :D But I dont know when I put it here. Maybe at the end of february. I dont know. I dont waanna say its big project. Its just.. again, something I do to my own things and I want to see others people reactions.. Or maybe not?

But anyway, thanks for the 26,86 seconds of your life that you spent reading this.
